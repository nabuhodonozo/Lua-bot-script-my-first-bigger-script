# Robot

This one of my first projects I have written on my own. Sadly this is the only one that I have saved somewhere. Others do not exist anymore.
I have written this one when I was around 14 years old. It was time when everyone was playing minecraft game, and I have spent countless hours to write this bot in notepad instead of playing game. 

Functions:
* This bot is tracking it's own position reletive to starting point
* It's taking dimensions from user (in game)
* Starts digging hole
* if it's full of resources then it comes back to surface and puts them in chest
* if it needs more fuel, then it tries to refuel itself (if has any coal in inventory) or comes back to surface and asks for refueling
